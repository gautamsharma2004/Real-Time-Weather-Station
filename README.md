# Real Time Arduino Weather Station with AQI
A simple and effective real-time weather and air quality monitoring station built using an Arduino NANO. This project uses a DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, and an MQ135 gas sensor to estimate the Air Quality Index (AQI). All data is displayed on a TFT screen and refreshed automatically every 5 seconds, with a visual countdown timer indicating the time until the next update.
Features
Real-time Data: Measures and displays current temperature (Â°C) and humidity (%).
Air Quality Monitoring: Senses various gases using the MQ135 sensor to provide an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading.
Visual Display: Presents all information clearly on a color TFT display.
Auto-Refresh: Automatically updates sensor readings every 5 seconds.
Update Countdown: Shows a countdown timer on the screen, so you know exactly when the next reading will occur.

Software & Libraries
This project is built using the Arduino IDE. You will need to install the following libraries through the Arduino IDE's Library Manager (Tools > Manage Libraries...):
Adafruit GFX Library: The core graphics library.
Search for Adafruit GFX Library in the Library Manager.
Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 Library: Driver for the TFT display.
Search for Adafruit ST7735 in the Library Manager. (Note: If you have a different display like an ILI9341, install the corresponding Adafruit library).
DHT sensor library by Adafruit: For interfacing with the DHT11 sensor.
Search for DHT sensor library in the Library Manager.
MQ135 Library: A library to simplify reading values from the MQ135 sensor. A popular choice is the one by G.K.Das.
Search for MQ135 in the Library Manager.
